# Audit Context

Critical analysis of `product/product-context.md` to identify issues before implementation.

**Purpose:** Identify gaps, errors, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and workflow problems in the product context file. Generate a comprehensive report with actionable recommendations.

**Output:**

- Terminal display of findings
- `product/audit-report.md` — Detailed report for reference

**Language:** Report is generated in English. Conversation can be in user's preferred language.

> **Code Block Conventions:** Code blocks in this command serve two purposes:
>
> - **Executable bash** — Marked with `bash` language tag, contains valid shell commands
> - **Pseudocode/guidance** — Describes logic the agent should implement (e.g., `HIGH_COUNT=$(count issues with 🔴)`)
>
> When pseudocode appears, implement equivalent logic rather than running literally.

## Step 1: Validate Context File

Check that the context file exists and has minimum required content.

```bash
CONTEXT_FILE="product/product-context.md"
REPORT_FILE="product/audit-report.md"

if [ ! -f "$CONTEXT_FILE" ]; then
  echo "Error: product-context.md - File not found. Run /product-interview first to create the product context."
  exit 1
fi

# Check minimum content (file should have > 500 chars excluding whitespace)
CONTENT_LENGTH=$(tr -d '[:space:]' < "$CONTEXT_FILE" | wc -c)
if [ "$CONTENT_LENGTH" -lt 500 ]; then
  echo "Error: product-context.md - File is empty or incomplete. Run /product-interview to complete the interview."
  exit 1
fi

# Save previous report values for comparison (used in Step 10)
PREV_HIGH=0
PREV_MEDIUM=0
PREV_LOW=0
PREV_REPORT_EXISTS=false

if [ -f "$REPORT_FILE" ]; then
  PREV_REPORT_EXISTS=true
  PREV_HIGH=$(grep "🔴 HIGH" "$REPORT_FILE" | grep -oE '[0-9]+' | head -1 || echo 0)
  PREV_MEDIUM=$(grep "🟠 MEDIUM" "$REPORT_FILE" | grep -oE '[0-9]+' | head -1 || echo 0)
  PREV_LOW=$(grep "🟡 LOW" "$REPORT_FILE" | grep -oE '[0-9]+' | head -1 || echo 0)
fi

# Verify essential file structure
STRUCTURE_VALID=true
STRUCTURE_WARNINGS=""

if ! grep -q "^## Quick Reference" "$CONTEXT_FILE"; then
  STRUCTURE_WARNINGS="${STRUCTURE_WARNINGS}\n  - Missing Quick Reference section"
  STRUCTURE_VALID=false
fi

if ! grep -q "^Completeness:" "$CONTEXT_FILE"; then
  STRUCTURE_WARNINGS="${STRUCTURE_WARNINGS}\n  - Missing Completeness line"
  STRUCTURE_VALID=false
fi

SECTION_COUNT=$(grep -c "^## [0-9]\+\." "$CONTEXT_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
if [ "$SECTION_COUNT" -lt 6 ]; then
  STRUCTURE_WARNINGS="${STRUCTURE_WARNINGS}\n  - Only $SECTION_COUNT/12 category sections found"
  STRUCTURE_VALID=false
fi

if ! grep -q "^## Cross-Reference" "$CONTEXT_FILE"; then
  STRUCTURE_WARNINGS="${STRUCTURE_WARNINGS}\n  - Missing Cross-Reference section"
  STRUCTURE_VALID=false
fi

if [ "$STRUCTURE_VALID" = false ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Structure warnings detected:$STRUCTURE_WARNINGS"
  echo ""
  echo "The context file may be corrupted or incomplete."
  echo "Consider running /product-interview to regenerate."
  echo ""
  # Continue with audit but note issues in report
fi
```

**Parse basic info:**

```bash
# Extract product name
PRODUCT_NAME=$(grep "^# Product Context:" "$CONTEXT_FILE" | sed 's/^# Product Context: //')
if [ -z "$PRODUCT_NAME" ]; then
  PRODUCT_NAME="Unknown Product"
fi

# Extract completeness percentage
COMPLETENESS=$(grep "^Completeness:" "$CONTEXT_FILE" | grep -oE '[0-9]+' | head -1)
if [ -z "$COMPLETENESS" ]; then
  COMPLETENESS=0
fi

echo "�� Critical Analysis: $PRODUCT_NAME"
echo "📊 Context Completeness: ${COMPLETENESS}%"
echo ""
```

---

## Step 2: Quality Checks

Analyze answer quality for each category.

| Check ID | Pattern                                                    | Severity  | Description                                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Q-001    | Answers < 10 words for open questions                      | 🟠 MEDIUM | Short answers may lack necessary detail      |
| Q-002    | Generic placeholders: "TBD", "N/A", "later", "TBA", "TODO" | 🔴 HIGH   | Placeholder instead of concrete answer       |
| Q-003    | Answer echoes the question                                 | 🟠 MEDIUM | Answer repeats question without adding value |
| Q-004    | Missing specifics: no numbers, examples                    | 🟡 LOW    | Vague answer lacking concrete details        |
| Q-005    | Empty subsections (heading with no content)                | 🔴 HIGH   | Required section has no content              |

**Check implementation:**

For each of the 12 categories, extract the section content and run quality checks:

1. **Q-002 (Placeholders):** Search for patterns like `TBD`, `TODO`, `TBA`, `N/A`, `later`, `to be determined`, `not yet decided`
2. **Q-005 (Empty sections):** Look for `### ` headings followed immediately by another `### ` or `## ` without content between
3. **Q-001 (Short answers):** For subsections, count words between heading and next heading
4. **Q-004 (No specifics):** Check if section contains any numbers or specific examples

Report format for each finding:

```
🔴 Q-002: Category [N] contains placeholder "TBD" at line [X]
   Location: ### [Subsection Name]
   Current: "TBD - will decide later"
   Recommendation: Provide concrete answer or run /product-interview --stage=X to complete
```

---

## Step 3: Consistency Checks

Verify that answers across categories are logically consistent.

> **Relationship to /product-interview:** `/product-interview` includes a subset of consistency checks (quick checks during the interview). This command provides the **comprehensive check set** (C-001 through C-020) for thorough validation. Both commands complement each other: interview catches obvious conflicts early, audit provides deep analysis after context is complete.

| Check ID | Condition                                   | Severity  | Message                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| C-001    | GDPR compliance + No audit log              | 🔴 HIGH   | "GDPR requires audit logging. Add full audit in Category 4."    |
| C-002    | No auth + Compliance-grade audit            | 🔴 HIGH   | "Audit logging without authentication is contradictory."        |
| C-003    | Real-time + 10k+ users + No scale plan      | 🔴 HIGH   | "High-scale real-time needs explicit architecture."             |
| C-004    | Full offline + No sync strategy             | 🔴 HIGH   | "Offline mode requires data synchronization strategy."          |
| C-005    | SSO/Enterprise + Free/OSS model             | 🟠 MEDIUM | "Enterprise features conflict with free model."                 |
| C-006    | Multi-tenant + No data isolation            | 🔴 HIGH   | "Multi-tenant requires explicit data isolation."                |
| C-007    | File uploads + No size limits               | 🟠 MEDIUM | "File uploads need size/type restrictions."                     |
| C-008    | Search feature + No indexing strategy       | 🟡 LOW    | "Advanced search benefits from indexing strategy."              |
| C-009    | Mobile-first + No touch interactions        | 🟠 MEDIUM | "Mobile-first should include touch gestures."                   |
| C-010    | Desktop-only + Mobile navigation            | 🟡 LOW    | "Desktop-only conflicts with mobile navigation choice."         |
| C-011    | Strict auth + No MFA                        | 🟠 MEDIUM | "Strict authentication should include MFA option."              |
| C-012    | PWA + Desktop-only responsive               | 🟠 MEDIUM | "PWA implies mobile support, conflicts with desktop-only."      |
| C-013    | Collaborative real-time + Full offline      | 🟠 MEDIUM | "Real-time collaboration and full offline are hard to combine." |
| C-014    | Large file uploads + Full offline           | 🟡 LOW    | "Large files offline is technically challenging."               |
| C-015    | Versioning + Hard delete                    | 🟠 MEDIUM | "Versioning usually implies soft delete, not hard delete."      |
| C-016    | PII data + No encryption mention            | 🟠 MEDIUM | "Personal data should mention encryption requirements."         |
| C-017    | HIPAA + No audit logging                    | 🔴 HIGH   | "HIPAA requires comprehensive audit logging."                   |
| C-018    | Payment integration + No PCI-DSS            | 🔴 HIGH   | "Payment processing requires PCI-DSS compliance."               |
| C-019    | E2E full regression + Minimal test coverage | 🟠 MEDIUM | "Full E2E regression conflicts with minimal test target."       |
| C-020    | WCAG AAA + No accessibility persona         | 🟡 LOW    | "AAA compliance should specify accessibility needs."            |

**Check implementation example:**

```bash
# C-001: GDPR without audit log
check_c001() {
  local GDPR_MENTIONED=$(grep -ci "GDPR" "$CONTEXT_FILE")
  local AUDIT_FULL=$(grep -A5 -i "audit" "$CONTEXT_FILE" | grep -ci "full\|comprehensive\|complete")

  if [ "$GDPR_MENTIONED" -gt 0 ] && [ "$AUDIT_FULL" -eq 0 ]; then
    return 0  # Issue found
  fi
  return 1  # No issue
}
```

For each failed check, report:

```
🔴 C-001: GDPR compliance without audit logging
   Found: Category 10 mentions GDPR compliance
   Missing: Category 4 Audit level is not "Full" or "Comprehensive"
   Impact: Cannot claim GDPR compliance without proper audit trail
   Fix: Update Category 4 to specify full audit logging
```

## Step 4: Logic Checks

Detect contradictory decisions within the same context.

| Check ID | Detection                                                 | Severity  | Message                                                              |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| L-001    | "beginners" in audience + "advanced" features only        | 🟠 MEDIUM | "Target audience (beginners) conflicts with advanced-only features." |
| L-002    | "Free/Open Source" model + "Enterprise SLA" mention       | 🔴 HIGH   | "Free model cannot include enterprise SLA commitments."              |
| L-003    | "MVP" scope + All 12 categories at 100% detail            | 🟡 LOW    | "MVP scope usually means fewer features, not comprehensive."         |
| L-004    | Primary persona conflicts with secondary persona          | 🟡 LOW    | "Check if personas have conflicting needs."                          |
| L-005    | "Simple" data model + Complex audit/versioning            | 🟠 MEDIUM | "Simple data model conflicts with complex audit requirements."       |
| L-006    | "No auth" + Role-based access control                     | 🔴 HIGH   | "Cannot have RBAC without authentication."                           |
| L-007    | "Internal tool" + Public API exposure                     | 🟠 MEDIUM | "Internal tools rarely need public API."                             |
| L-008    | "Minimal" test coverage + "Compliance-grade" requirements | 🟠 MEDIUM | "Compliance usually requires higher test coverage."                  |

Report format:

```
🔴 L-006: Authentication contradiction
   Found in Category 9: "No authentication - public access"
   Conflicts with Category 10: "Role-based access control for admin features"
   Problem: RBAC requires user identity, which requires authentication
   Fix: Either add authentication or remove RBAC requirement
```

---

## Step 5: Ambiguity Checks

Identify vague or unclear requirements that may cause implementation issues.

| Check ID | Pattern                                                                       | Severity  | Message                                         |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| A-001    | Vague quantity terms: "fast", "good", "many", "some", "various", "several"    | 🟡 LOW    | "Vague term found. Specify concrete value."     |
| A-002    | Unclear references: "the system", "it", "they" without clear antecedent       | 🟡 LOW    | "Unclear reference. Specify what exactly."      |
| A-003    | Open-ended lists: "or similar", "etc.", "and more", "and so on"               | 🟡 LOW    | "Open-ended list. Enumerate specific items."    |
| A-004    | Conditional without specifics: "if needed", "when appropriate", "as required" | 🟠 MEDIUM | "Condition undefined. Specify when exactly."    |
| A-005    | Ranges without target: "10-1000 users" without specifying expected/target     | 🟡 LOW    | "Range without target. Specify expected value." |
| A-006    | Multiple options without decision: "A or B or C" with no preference           | 🟠 MEDIUM | "Multiple options listed. Make a decision."     |

**Pattern detection:**

```bash
# A-001: Vague quantity terms
VAGUE_PATTERNS="\\bfast\\b|\\bgood\\b|\\bmany\\b|\\bsome\\b|\\bvarious\\b|\\bseveral\\b|\\bfew\\b|\\bquick\\b|\\beasy\\b"
VAGUE_MATCHES=$(grep -ciE "$VAGUE_PATTERNS" "$CONTEXT_FILE")

# A-003: Open-ended lists
OPENENDED_PATTERNS="or similar|etc\\.|and more|and so on|among others"
OPENENDED_MATCHES=$(grep -ciE "$OPENENDED_PATTERNS" "$CONTEXT_FILE")
```

Report excessive vagueness (threshold: >5 instances per pattern):

```
🟡 A-001: Multiple vague terms found (12 occurrences)
   Examples found at:
   - Line 45: "fast loading times" → Specify: "< 2 second load time"
   - Line 78: "many users" → Specify: "up to 1000 concurrent users"
   - Line 123: "good UX" → Specify: "WCAG AA compliant, < 3 clicks to any feature"
   Recommendation: Replace vague terms with specific, measurable criteria
```

---

## Step 6: Duplication Checks

Identify redundant or contradictory information.

| Check ID | Detection                                               | Severity  | Message                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D-001    | Same answer appears in 2+ categories                    | 🟡 LOW    | "Duplicate content between categories. Consider consolidating." |
| D-002    | Contradictory info about same topic in different places | 🔴 HIGH   | "Contradictory information about [topic]."                      |
| D-003    | Quick Reference table status mismatches category detail | 🟠 MEDIUM | "Quick Reference shows ✅ but category has incomplete content." |
| D-004    | Cross-Reference lists category that is ❌ Empty         | 🟡 LOW    | "Cross-Reference mentions category [N] but it's empty."         |

**D-003 Check implementation:**

1. Parse Quick Reference table for category statuses (✅/⚠️/❌)
2. For each category marked ✅:
   - Check if category section exists
   - Check if section has substantive content (not just placeholders)
   - Flag mismatch if ✅ but content is incomplete

Report format:

```
🟠 D-003: Quick Reference mismatch
   Quick Reference shows: Category 4 ✅ Complete
   Actual content: Category 4 has 2 subsections with "TBD"
   Impact: May proceed thinking category is ready when it's not
   Fix: Update Quick Reference to ⚠️ Partial, or complete Category 4
```

**D-004 Check implementation:**

1. Parse Cross-Reference section for command-to-category mappings
2. For each category mentioned in Cross-Reference:
   - Check if Quick Reference shows ❌ Empty for that category
   - Flag if a command references an empty category

Report format:

```
🟡 D-004: Cross-Reference references empty category
   Cross-Reference: /shape-section uses Category 8
   Quick Reference: Category 8 ❌ Empty
   Impact: Command may not have required context
   Fix: Run /product-interview --stage=scale to complete Category 8
```

---

## Step 7: Command Readiness

Verify context completeness for each downstream Design OS command.

| Command            | Required Categories | Optional Categories | Ready When           |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| `/product-vision`  | 1, 2                | —                   | Both ✅              |
| `/product-roadmap` | 1                   | 2, 8                | 1 is ✅              |
| `/data-model`      | 4, 10               | 1                   | Both 4, 10 are ✅    |
| `/design-tokens`   | 3                   | 1                   | 3 is ✅              |
| `/design-shell`    | 2, 3                | 7, 9                | 2 and 3 are ✅       |
| `/shape-section`   | 5, 6                | 8, 11               | Both 5, 6 are ✅     |
| `/sample-data`     | 4, 5                | —                   | Both 4, 5 are ✅     |
| `/design-screen`   | 5, 6                | 3, 7, 11            | 5 and 6 are ✅       |
| `/export-product`  | 9, 10, 12           | all others          | All 9, 10, 12 are ✅ |

> **Note:** Categories are aligned with the Cross-Reference section in `/product-interview` output. Required categories BLOCK the command; Optional categories provide enhanced context but won't prevent execution.

**Check implementation:**

```bash
check_command_readiness() {
  local CMD=$1
  local REQUIRED_CATS=$2
  local ALL_READY=true
  local BLOCKING=""

  for cat in $REQUIRED_CATS; do
    # Look for category in Quick Reference table
    CAT_LINE=$(grep -E "^\| *$cat\." "$CONTEXT_FILE" | head -1)
    if ! echo "$CAT_LINE" | grep -qE "(✅|Complete)"; then
      ALL_READY=false
      BLOCKING="$BLOCKING $cat"
    fi
  done

  if [ "$ALL_READY" = true ]; then
    echo "✅"
  else
    echo "❌ (missing:$BLOCKING)"
  fi
}
```

Output table:

```
## Command Readiness

| Command | Status | Blocking Categories | Blocking Issues |
|---------|--------|--------------------|-----------------|
| /product-vision | ✅ Ready | — | — |
| /product-roadmap | ✅ Ready | — | — |
| /data-model | ⚠️ Partial | 10 | C-001 |
| /design-tokens | ✅ Ready | — | — |
| /design-shell | ✅ Ready | — | C-009 (warning) |
| /shape-section | ✅ Ready | — | — |
| /sample-data | ⚠️ Partial | 4 | Q-002 |
| /design-screen | ✅ Ready | — | — |
| /export-product | ❌ Blocked | 9, 10, 12 | C-001, L-002 |
```

## Step 8: Generate Report

After running all checks, generate the comprehensive report.

### 8.1: Calculate Summary

```bash
# Count issues by severity
HIGH_COUNT=$(count issues with 🔴)
MEDIUM_COUNT=$(count issues with 🟠)
LOW_COUNT=$(count issues with 🟡)
TOTAL_ISSUES=$((HIGH_COUNT + MEDIUM_COUNT + LOW_COUNT))

# Determine recommendation
if [ "$HIGH_COUNT" -eq 0 ] && [ "$MEDIUM_COUNT" -eq 0 ]; then
  RECOMMENDATION="✅ PROCEED"
  REC_MESSAGE="Context is solid. Ready for implementation."
elif [ "$HIGH_COUNT" -eq 0 ]; then
  RECOMMENDATION="⚠️ FIX RECOMMENDED"
  REC_MESSAGE="Consider addressing MEDIUM issues before proceeding."
elif [ "$HIGH_COUNT" -le 2 ]; then
  RECOMMENDATION="⚠️ FIX REQUIRED"
  REC_MESSAGE="Fix HIGH priority issues before proceeding."
else
  RECOMMENDATION="🔴 MAJOR REVISION NEEDED"
  REC_MESSAGE="Significant issues found. Thorough revision required."
fi
```

### 8.2: Report Structure

Write to `product/audit-report.md`:

```markdown
# Critical Analysis Report: [Product Name]

**Generated:** [ISO date]
**Context File:** product/product-context.md
**Context Completeness:** [X]%
**Issues Found:** [N] total (🔴 [X] HIGH, 🟠 [Y] MEDIUM, 🟡 [Z] LOW)

## AI Implementation Guidelines

> **For AI Agents:** When fixing issues in `product-context.md`, follow these strict rules to preserve file integrity.

### File Structure Rules

**CRITICAL — DO NOT MODIFY:**

- Line 1: `# Product Context: [Product Name]` — header format
- Lines 2-5: Metadata block (`Generated:`, `Last Updated:`, `Completeness:`, `Mode:`)
- `## Quick Reference` table structure and column format
- `## N. Category Name` section headers (1-12)
- `## Cross-Reference: Design OS Commands` section structure

**SAFE TO MODIFY:**

- Content under `### Subsection` headings within categories
- Values after field labels (e.g., `**Provider:** [value here]`)
- List items under subsections
- Text within existing markdown structures

### Edit Location Rules

| Issue Type            | Where to Edit                                  | How to Locate                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Q-002 (Placeholder)   | Replace placeholder text in-place              | Search for exact placeholder string                    |
| Q-005 (Empty section) | Add content under existing `### Heading`       | Find the `### Heading`, add below it                   |
| C-XXX (Consistency)   | Update conflicting value in specified category | Go to `## N. Category`, find relevant `### Subsection` |
| L-XXX (Logic)         | Fix the value causing contradiction            | Locate by category + subsection from issue             |
| A-XXX (Ambiguity)     | Replace vague term with specific value         | Search for quoted vague term                           |

### Edit Pattern

**ALWAYS use this pattern:**

1. **Read** the current content of the target subsection
2. **Identify** the exact line(s) to change
3. **Replace** only the problematic content, preserving:
   - The `### Subsection` heading
   - The field label format (e.g., `**Field:**`)
   - Surrounding content that is correct
4. **Verify** the edit didn't change structure

### Example Fixes

**Q-002 Fix (Placeholder → Concrete Value):**
\`\`\`
LOCATE: ## 9. Integration Points → ### Authentication
FIND: **Provider:** TBD - will decide later
REPLACE WITH: **Provider:** OAuth 2.0 (Google, GitHub)
PRESERVE: Everything else in the section
\`\`\`

**Q-005 Fix (Empty Section → Add Content):**
\`\`\`
LOCATE: ## 3. Design Direction → ### Visual Inspiration
CURRENT: ### Visual Inspiration
[empty]
ADD AFTER HEADING: - **Linear** — Clean, minimal interface with subtle animations - **Notion** — Flexible blocks, keyboard-first navigation
PRESERVE: The ### heading itself, next ### or ## section
\`\`\`

**C-001 Fix (GDPR without audit):**
\`\`\`
LOCATE: ## 4. Data Architecture → ### Audit & History
FIND: **Level:** Basic
REPLACE WITH: **Level:** Full audit — Who changed what, when, with old values (required for GDPR)
PRESERVE: All other subsections in Category 4
\`\`\`

### Automatic Validation Protocol

> **MANDATORY:** AI agents MUST run validation before AND after editing `product-context.md`.

#### Pre-Edit Validation

\`\`\`bash
CONTEXT_FILE="product/product-context.md"

# 1. Count sections (must be 12)

SECTION_COUNT=$(grep -c "^## [0-9]\+\." "$CONTEXT_FILE")
echo "Sections: $SECTION_COUNT/12"

# 2. Verify Quick Reference exists

grep -q "^## Quick Reference" "$CONTEXT_FILE" && echo "Quick Reference: ✓" || echo "Quick Reference: MISSING"

# 3. Verify Completeness line format

grep -q "^Completeness:" "$CONTEXT_FILE" && echo "Completeness line: ✓" || echo "Completeness line: MISSING"

# 4. Count subsections per category (for comparison)

for i in $(seq 1 12); do
  SUBSECTION_COUNT=$(sed -n "/^## $i\./,/^## /p" "$CONTEXT_FILE" | grep -c "^### ")
echo "Category $i subsections: $SUBSECTION_COUNT"
done

# 5. Calculate file hash for rollback reference

FILE_HASH=$(md5 -q "$CONTEXT_FILE" 2>/dev/null || md5sum "$CONTEXT_FILE" | cut -d' ' -f1)
echo "Pre-edit hash: $FILE_HASH"
\`\`\`

#### Post-Edit Validation

\`\`\`bash
VALIDATION_PASSED=true

# 1. Section count must still be 12

NEW_SECTION_COUNT=$(grep -c "^## [0-9]\+\." "$CONTEXT_FILE")
if [ "$NEW_SECTION_COUNT" -ne 12 ]; then
echo "❌ FAIL: Section count changed"
VALIDATION_PASSED=false
fi

# 2. Quick Reference must exist

if ! grep -q "^## Quick Reference" "$CONTEXT_FILE"; then
echo "❌ FAIL: Quick Reference section deleted"
VALIDATION_PASSED=false
fi

# 3. Completeness line must exist

if ! grep -q "^Completeness: [0-9]\+%" "$CONTEXT_FILE"; then
echo "❌ FAIL: Completeness line missing or malformed"
VALIDATION_PASSED=false
fi

# 4. Cross-Reference section must exist

if ! grep -q "^## Cross-Reference" "$CONTEXT_FILE"; then
echo "❌ FAIL: Cross-Reference section deleted"
VALIDATION_PASSED=false
fi

# 5. Report result

if [ "$VALIDATION_PASSED" = true ]; then
echo "✅ Validation PASSED: File structure intact"
else
echo "🔴 Validation FAILED: Revert changes immediately"
fi
\`\`\`

#### Rollback Protocol

If post-edit validation fails:

1. **DO NOT make additional edits**
2. **Report the failure** to the user
3. **Suggest restoration:** `git checkout -- product/product-context.md` or re-run `/product-interview`

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)

| Anti-Pattern                       | Why It's Wrong                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Append fixes to end of file        | Content must be in correct category/subsection |
| Delete section to rewrite it       | May lose content that wasn't flagged           |
| Change section numbering           | Numbers 1-12 are fixed structure               |
| Add new ## sections                | Only 12 categories exist                       |
| Modify Quick Reference table       | User updates this manually                     |
| Remove content that wasn't flagged | Only fix flagged issues                        |
```

### 8.3: Write Report File

```bash
# Create directory with error handling (standard pattern from agents.md)
mkdir -p product || {
  echo "Error: product directory - Failed to create. Check write permissions: ls -la ."
  exit 1
}

cat > "$REPORT_FILE" << 'EOF'
[Generated report content]
EOF

# Verify file was created
if [ ! -f "$REPORT_FILE" ]; then
  echo "Error: $REPORT_FILE - Failed to create report file."
  exit 1
fi

echo "📄 Report saved to: $REPORT_FILE"
```

### 8.4: Validate Report Structure

Verify the generated report has all required sections.

```bash
VALIDATION_ERRORS=0

# 1. Check Executive Summary exists
if ! grep -q "^## Executive Summary" "$REPORT_FILE"; then
  echo "Warning: Executive Summary section missing from report"
  VALIDATION_ERRORS=$((VALIDATION_ERRORS + 1))
fi

# 2. Check Issues Found section exists
if ! grep -q "^## Issues Found" "$REPORT_FILE"; then
  echo "Warning: Issues Found section missing from report"
  VALIDATION_ERRORS=$((VALIDATION_ERRORS + 1))
fi

# 3. Check Command Readiness section exists
if ! grep -q "^## Command Readiness" "$REPORT_FILE"; then
  echo "Warning: Command Readiness section missing from report"
  VALIDATION_ERRORS=$((VALIDATION_ERRORS + 1))
fi

# 4. Verify issue counts match summary
REPORTED_HIGH=$(grep "🔴 HIGH" "$REPORT_FILE" | head -1 | grep -oE '[0-9]+' | head -1)
ACTUAL_HIGH=$(grep -c "^#### \[ISSUE-" "$REPORT_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
# Note: Simplified check - full validation would verify each severity level

# 5. Report validation results
if [ $VALIDATION_ERRORS -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "Warning: $VALIDATION_ERRORS validation issues in generated report"
else
  echo "Report structure validated successfully"
fi
```

> **Recovery:** If validation fails, check the issue detection logic in Steps 2-6. The report generation may have incomplete data.

## Step 9: Display Summary & Next Steps

### 9.1: Terminal Summary

Display concise summary in terminal:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔍 CRITICAL ANALYSIS COMPLETE: [Product Name]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📊 Context Completeness: [X]%

📋 Issues Found: [N] total
   🔴 HIGH:   [X]
   🟠 MEDIUM: [Y]
   🟡 LOW:    [Z]

📝 Full report: product/audit-report.md

**Recommendation:** [RECOMMENDATION]
[REC_MESSAGE]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### 9.2: Next Steps Options

Present options to user:

"Ce vrei să faci în continuare?"

**Options:**

- **Revizuiesc raportul** — Open product/audit-report.md for detailed review
- **Corectez problemele** — Edit product-context.md and re-run /audit-context
- **Continui oricum** — Accept risks and proceed with Design OS commands
- **Ies** — Stop here for now

### 9.3: Guidance Based on Selection

**If "Revizuiesc raportul":**

```
Full report at: product/audit-report.md

Each issue includes:
- Clear problem description
- Current text from product-context.md
- Specific fix recommendation
- Impact if not fixed

After review:
1. Edit product/product-context.md with fixes
2. Re-run: /audit-context
3. When 0 HIGH issues: safe to proceed
```

**If "Corectez problemele":**

```
Recommended workflow:

1. Open product/product-context.md
2. For each ISSUE-XXX from report:
   - Locate the exact section (## Category → ### Subsection)
   - Apply the fix IN-PLACE (don't append to end)
   - Preserve surrounding content
3. Run: /audit-context
4. Repeat until HIGH = 0

Tip: Start with HIGH priority, leave LOW for later.
```

> **For AI agents:** See "AI Implementation Guidelines" section in the report for detailed editing rules including:
>
> - File structure rules (what to modify, what to preserve)
> - Edit location rules per issue type
> - Pre/post-edit validation protocol
> - Rollback instructions if validation fails

**If "Continui oricum":**

```
⚠️ Warning: [X] HIGH issues unresolved.

Affected commands:
- /data-model: may generate incomplete model
- /export-product: instructions may be incomplete

Proceed anyway? [Yes / No]
```

**If "Ies":**

```
Report saved at: product/audit-report.md

To resume later:
1. Review the report
2. Fix issues in product-context.md
3. Run: /audit-context
```

---

## Step 10: Re-run Detection (Optional)

If a previous report existed (detected in Step 1), compare with current run:

> **Note:** Previous values were saved in Step 1 BEFORE the new report overwrote the file. This ensures accurate comparison.

```bash
# Use pre-saved values from Step 1 (not reading from file, which was overwritten)
if [ "$PREV_REPORT_EXISTS" = true ]; then
  # Show comparison using pre-saved values
  echo "📊 Comparison with previous analysis:"
  echo ""
  echo "Before: $PREV_HIGH HIGH, $PREV_MEDIUM MEDIUM, $PREV_LOW LOW"
  echo "Now:    $HIGH_COUNT HIGH, $MEDIUM_COUNT MEDIUM, $LOW_COUNT LOW"
  echo ""

  # Calculate delta
  PREV_TOTAL=$((PREV_HIGH + PREV_MEDIUM + PREV_LOW))
  RESOLVED=$((PREV_TOTAL - TOTAL_ISSUES))
  if [ "$RESOLVED" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ Resolved: $RESOLVED issues fixed"
  elif [ "$RESOLVED" -lt 0 ]; then
    echo "⚠️ New issues: $((-RESOLVED)) additional issues found"
  else
    echo "➡️ No change in issue count"
  fi
fi
```

---

## Appendix: Issue ID Reference

All issue IDs follow the pattern `[Type]-[NNN]`:

| Prefix | Type        | Check Range    |
| ------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| Q      | Quality     | Q-001 to Q-005 |
| C      | Consistency | C-001 to C-020 |
| L      | Logic       | L-001 to L-008 |
| A      | Ambiguity   | A-001 to A-006 |
| D      | Duplication | D-001 to D-004 |

When reporting specific findings, use format `ISSUE-[NNN]` as unique identifier for each occurrence in the report.

---

## Notes

**Template System:** Unlike `/export-product`, this command does not use the template system in `.claude/templates/`. The report is generated directly from issue detection logic.

**Recovery if Interrupted:** This command is read-only and can simply be re-run if interrupted. No data is modified during execution — only the report file is created at the end (Step 8.3).
