## Instructions

Please carefully read and analyze the following files:

1. **@product-plan/product-overview.md** — Product summary with sections and data model overview
2. **@product-plan/instructions/one-shot-instructions.md** — Complete implementation instructions for all milestones

After reading these, also review:
- **@product-plan/design-system/** — Color and typography tokens
- **@product-plan/data-model/** — Entity types and relationships
- **@product-plan/shell/** — Application shell components
- **@product-plan/sections/** — All section components, types, sample data, and test instructions

Once I answer your questions, create a comprehensive implementation plan before coding.
