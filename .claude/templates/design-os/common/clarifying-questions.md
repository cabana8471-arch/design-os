<!-- v1.0.0 -->

## Before You Begin

Please ask me clarifying questions about:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - How should users sign up and log in? (email/password, OAuth providers, magic links?)
   - Are there different user roles with different permissions?
   - Should there be an admin interface?

2. **User & Account Modeling**
   - Is this a single-user app or multi-user?
   - Do users belong to organizations/teams/workspaces?
   - How should user profiles be structured?

3. **Tech Stack Preferences**
   - What backend framework/language should I use?
   - What database do you prefer?
   - Any specific hosting/deployment requirements?

4. **Backend Business Logic**
   - Any server-side logic, validations or processes needed beyond what's shown in the UI?
   - Background processes, notifications, or other processes to trigger?

5. **Any Other Clarifications**
   - Questions about specific features or user flows
   - Edge cases that need clarification
   - Integration requirements

Lastly, be sure to ask me if I have any other notes to add for this implementation.
