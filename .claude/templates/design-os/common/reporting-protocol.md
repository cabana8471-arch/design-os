## Implementation Reporting Protocol

As you implement each milestone/feature, write brief progress updates to reduce context usage:

**Format:**
```
✅ [Milestone/Feature] complete
📁 Files: [key files created/modified]
🧪 Tests: [number passing]
```

**Example:**
```
✅ Milestone 1 (Foundation) complete
📁 Files: src/app/layout.tsx, src/lib/theme.tsx, src/app/page.tsx
🧪 Tests: 12 passing

✅ Authentication system complete
📁 Files: src/lib/auth.ts, src/app/login/page.tsx
🧪 Tests: 8 passing
```

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Echo entire file contents back to conversation
- ❌ Quote large blocks of code unless specifically needed for discussion
- ❌ Repeat implementation details already documented

**DO:**
- ✅ Confirm completion with file paths
- ✅ Report test results
- ✅ Highlight any issues or decisions that need user input
