## Suggested Model Usage

For optimal cost-quality balance, consider this approach:

- **Claude Opus** → Initial implementation planning, architectural decisions, complex business logic
- **Claude Sonnet** → Implementing repetitive components, writing tests, routine CRUD operations
- **Claude Opus** → Final integration, edge cases, polish, and deployment

This is optional - use whichever model you prefer, but this can help optimize costs for large implementations.
