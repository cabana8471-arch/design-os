## Before You Begin

Please ask me clarifying questions about:

1. **Data Relationships**
   - How does this section's data relate to other entities?
   - Are there any cross-section dependencies?

2. **Integration Points**
   - How should this section connect to existing features?
   - Any API endpoints already built that this should use?

3. **Authentication & Authorization** (if not yet established)
   - How should users authenticate?
   - What permissions are needed for this section?

4. **Backend Business Logic**
   - Any server-side logic, validations or processes needed beyond what's shown in the UI?
   - Background processes, notifications, or other processes to trigger?

5. **Any Other Clarifications**
   - Questions about specific user flows in this section
   - Edge cases that need clarification
