# Section Implementation Prompt: [Product Name]

## Define Section Variables

Before using this prompt, replace these placeholders:

- **SECTION_NAME** = Human-readable name (e.g., "Invoices" or "Project Dashboard")
- **SECTION_ID** = Folder name in sections/ (e.g., "invoices" or "project-dashboard")
- **NN** = Two-digit milestone number, zero-padded (e.g., "02", "03". Foundation is "01", so first section is always "02")

---

I need you to implement the **SECTION_NAME** section of **[Product Name]**.
