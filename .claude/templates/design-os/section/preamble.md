# Section Implementation Prompt

## Define Section Variables

Before using this prompt, replace these placeholders:

- **SECTION_NAME** = [Human-readable name, e.g., "Invoices" or "Project Dashboard"]
- **SECTION_ID** = [Folder name in sections/, e.g., "invoices" or "project-dashboard"]
- **NN** = [Two-digit milestone number, zero-padded: "02", "03", etc. Foundation is "01", so first section is always "02"]

---

I need you to implement the **SECTION_NAME** section of my application.
