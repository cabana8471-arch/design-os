# Section Implementation Prompt

## Define Section Variables

- **SECTION_NAME** = [Human-readable name, e.g., "Invoices" or "Project Dashboard"]
- **SECTION_ID** = [Folder name in sections/, e.g., "invoices" or "project-dashboard"]
- **NN** = [Milestone number, e.g., "02" or "03" — sections start at 02 since 01 is Foundation]

---

I need you to implement the **SECTION_NAME** section of my application.
