| File                                              | Modification                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/product-interview.md` | v1.3.2 → v1.3.3: Added `--skip-validation --minimal` data loss warning, step execution order precedence note                                                                                                                   |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/audit-context.md`     | v1.1.3 → v1.1.4: Added implementations for C-002 to C-018 (HIGH severity), L-001/L-002/L-006 detection, A-002/A-004/A-005/A-006 patterns, D-001/D-002 algorithms, category names in Command Readiness, threshold clarification |

### Issues Resolved

**CRITICAL (1):**

- **G-001:** Missing implementation patterns for HIGH severity consistency checks (C-002, C-003, C-004, C-006, C-017, C-018) — only C-001 had an example. Added complete bash implementations for all 7 HIGH severity checks.

**HIGH (2):**

- **G-002:** Missing detection guidance for logic checks L-001 to L-008 — zero implementation logic existed. Added bash implementations for L-001, L-002, L-006 and semantic analysis notes for L-003, L-004, L-005, L-007, L-008.
- **L-001:** Ambiguity threshold contradiction — two conflicting rules for severity by occurrence count. Added clear table mapping location × count to severity (e.g., Categories 4,9,10 + 1-5 occurrences = MEDIUM).

**MEDIUM (6):**

- **G-003:** Missing implementation for ambiguity checks A-002, A-004, A-005, A-006 — only A-001 and A-003 had patterns. Added regex patterns and detection functions.
- **G-004:** Missing D-001 and D-002 detection algorithms — D-003, D-004, D-005 had implementations but D-001 (duplicate content) and D-002 (contradictions) were undefined. Added complete detection scripts.
- **L-002:** Step 0 vs Step 1 precedence unclear — if stage categories complete, unclear which exits first. Added "Step Execution Order" note explaining Step 0 checks run before Step 1.
- **L-003:** `--skip-validation --minimal` data loss risk — combination could silently lose categories 2,4,8,9,10,12. Added warning row to conflicting arguments table.
- **I-001:** Category names missing from Command Readiness table — only showed numbers (1-12). Added full category names for clarity.
- **A-001:** "Empty subsection" definition unclear — Q-005 had no word count threshold. Added table: 0-25 chars = Empty, 26-100 = Minimal, 100+ = Complete.

**LOW (2):**

- **I-003:** Issue numbering vs Check ID confusion — unclear relationship between ISSUE-NNN and X-NNN. Added clarifying table and note explaining Check ID = rule, Issue ID = occurrence.
- **D-005 Appendix:** Check range showed D-001 to D-004 but D-005 exists. Fixed to D-001 to D-005.

### Statistics

## [2025-12-31 14:15] Critical Analysis v1.3.2 & v1.1.3: Edge Cases & Documentation Clarity

### Description

Third comprehensive critical analysis of `/product-interview` v1.3.1 and `/audit-context` v1.1.2 identified 12 issues (0 critical, 5 medium, 7 low). All issues have been resolved with focus on edge case handling, documentation precision, and validation robustness.

### New Files Created

None.

### Modified Files

| File                                              | Modification                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/product-interview.md` | v1.3.1 → v1.3.2: Added multi-part question UX (revisit Part A, Part B >4 options), all-stages-complete handler, Required/Optional question type table |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/audit-context.md`     | v1.1.2 → v1.1.3: Added D-005 duplicate check, ambiguity threshold, subsection definition, enhanced recovery protocol, completeness verification       |
| `agents.md`                                       | Updated Command Versions table with v1.3.2 and v1.1.3 notes                                                                                           |

### Issues Resolved

**MEDIUM (5):**

- **M-1:** Command Readiness vs File Prerequisites mismatch — audit-context only checked category completeness, not file existence. Added clarifying note in Step 7 explaining both are needed.
- **M-2:** D-004 check logic inconsistency — check could never trigger because /product-interview filters Cross-Reference to omit empty categories. Added note explaining D-004 catches manually corrupted/legacy files.
- **M-3:** Ambiguity threshold undefined — ">5 instances" not operationally defined. Added explicit threshold: 6+ = MEDIUM, <6 = LOW, always report in categories 4,9,10.
- **M-4:** Multi-part question UX unclear — no guidance for revisiting Part A or handling Part B with >4 options. Added points 5-6 to Multi-Part Question Flow.
- **M-5:** Subsection definition missing — validation referenced SUBSECTION_COUNT without definition. Added "Subsection Definition" section with expected counts per category.

**LOW (7):**

- **L-1:** Infinite loop risk in stage mode — if user selects "Vedem altă zonă" but ALL stages complete, no handler. Added all-stages-complete edge case with congratulations message.
- **L-2:** Question skip status ambiguity — unclear which questions are required vs optional. Added Required/Optional/Conditional question type table.
- **L-3:** Case sensitivity in pattern matching — A-001 patterns shown in lowercase without case-sensitivity note. Added note: "All pattern matching uses case-insensitive search".
- **L-4:** Cross-Reference duplicate detection missing — no check for duplicate category entries. Added D-005 check with implementation script.
- **L-5:** Report issue ordering unspecified — no rules for ordering issues in report. Added: by severity → category → check type, sequential ISSUE-NNN numbering.
- **L-6:** Recovery step missing for validation failure — Step 8.4 mentioned "recovery" without details. Enhanced Rollback Protocol with three recovery options (git, interview, partial).
- **L-7:** Completeness percentage not verified — audit extracted completeness but didn't verify accuracy. Added verification that recalculates from Quick Reference and flags mismatches.

### Statistics

- Files modified: 3
- Issues resolved: 12 (0 HIGH, 5 MEDIUM, 7 LOW)
- Version bumps: product-interview v1.3.1 → v1.3.2, audit-context v1.1.2 → v1.1.3
- New checks added: D-005 (Cross-Reference duplicates)

### Verification

- ✅ Multi-Part Question Flow has 6 points (added revisit Part A, Part B >4 options)
- ✅ All-stages-complete handler with congratulations message
- ✅ Required/Optional/Conditional question type table added
- ✅ D-004 note explains it catches corrupted/legacy files
- ✅ D-005 check added for duplicate category entries
- ✅ Ambiguity threshold explicitly defined (6+ = MEDIUM)
- ✅ Subsection Definition section with expected counts table
- ✅ Case-insensitive matching note added
- ✅ Issue ordering rules added (severity → category → check type)
- ✅ Enhanced Rollback Protocol with three recovery options
- ✅ Completeness verification with mismatch detection
- ✅ File prerequisites note in Command Readiness
- ✅ agents.md Command Versions updated

### Remaining Items

None — both commands are production-ready at v1.3.2 and v1.1.3.

## [2025-12-31 13:30] Critical Analysis: Version Headers & Step Numbering Fixes

### Description

Comprehensive critical analysis of all Design OS files (excluding `/src`) identified 8 issues across documentation consistency and step numbering. All issues have been resolved including adding version headers to 10 command files, fixing "Step -1" naming convention, and updating agents.md documentation.

### New Files Created

None.

### Modified Files

| File                                              | Modification                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/product-vision.md`    | Added version header `<!-- v1.0.0 -->`                                                                  |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/product-roadmap.md`   | Added version header `<!-- v1.0.0 -->`                                                                  |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/data-model.md`        | Added version header `<!-- v1.0.0 -->`                                                                  |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/design-tokens.md`     | Added version header `<!-- v1.0.0 -->`                                                                  |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/design-shell.md`      | Added version header `<!-- v1.0.0 -->`, fixed "Step -1" → "Step 0", renumbered to "Step 0.1" for detect |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/shape-section.md`     | Added version header `<!-- v1.0.0 -->`                                                                  |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/sample-data.md`       | Added version header `<!-- v1.0.0 -->`                                                                  |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/design-screen.md`     | Added version header `<!-- v1.0.0 -->`, fixed "Step -1" → "Step 0"                                      |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/screenshot-design.md` | Added version header `<!-- v1.0.0 -->`                                                                  |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/export-product.md`    | Added version header `<!-- v1.0.0 -->`                                                                  |
| `agents.md`                                       | Clarified ShellPreview.tsx as generated, added Count column to Hookify table with totals                |

### Issues Resolved

**MEDIUM (2):**

- **MEDIUM-001:** 10 of 12 command files lacked version headers — only `audit-context.md` (v1.1.2) and `product-interview.md` (v1.3.1) had versions. Added `<!-- v1.0.0 -->` to all 10 missing files.
- **MEDIUM-002:** `design-shell.md` and `design-screen.md` used "Step -1: Validate Product Context" — inconsistent with all other commands using "Step 0". Fixed naming and renumbered design-shell.md steps (Step 0 → Validate Context, Step 0.1 → Detect Existing Shell).

**LOW (6):**

- **LOW-001:** agents.md listed ShellPreview.tsx without noting it's generated — clarified as "Generated by `/design-shell`".
- **LOW-002:** agents.md Hookify Rule Categories table lacked Count column — synced with `.claude/hookify/README.md` (added counts and total: 22 rules).
- **LOW-003:** Step Index table in design-shell.md didn't reflect step renumbering — updated to show Step 0 (Validate) and Step 0.1 (Detect).
- **LOW-004:** Workflow Structure comment referenced old step numbers — updated to reflect Step 0.1-0.7 range.
- **LOW-005:** Reference "continue to Step 0" in completeness table — updated to "Step 0.1".
- **LOW-006:** Reference "from Step 0" in Post-Audit Actions — updated to "from Step 0.1".

### False Positives Identified (Not Issues)

During analysis, 6 reported issues were verified as false positives:

- "Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines" section DOES exist in SKILL.md (line 52)
- Hookify path structure IS correctly documented in README.md
- Mobile-first vs Desktop-first IS properly explained in agents.md
- Shell Component Categories table already correctly states components are generated
- Product Scope Persistence IS documented in agents.md
- Shell Relationships step numbers refer to different workflow phases (intentional)

### Statistics

- Files modified: 11
- Issues resolved: 8 (0 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, 6 LOW)
- False positives eliminated: 6
- Version headers added: 10 command files

### Verification

- ✅ All 12 command files now have version headers
- ✅ All commands use "Step 0" for context validation (not "Step -1")
- ✅ design-shell.md Step Index table updated with correct numbering
- ✅ agents.md ShellPreview.tsx clarified as generated
- ✅ agents.md Hookify table has Count column and total (22 rules)
- ✅ All step references in design-shell.md updated

### Remaining Items

None — all identified issues resolved. Application is production-ready.

## [2025-12-31 12:30] /audit-context v1.1.2: Documentation Clarity

### Description

Minor documentation improvement to clarify the relationship between Command Readiness "Optional" column and Cross-Reference section.

### New Files Created

None.

### Modified Files

| File                                          | Modification                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/audit-context.md` | v1.1.1 → v1.1.2: Clarified why Optional column may include categories not in Cross-Reference |

### Issues Resolved

**LOW (1):**

- **LOW-001:** Optional column interpretation unclear — the "Relationship to Cross-Reference" note didn't explain why Optional might include categories not directly referenced. Added clarification that general context (like Category 1 - Product Foundation) enhances any command's output.

### Statistics

- Files modified: 1
- Issues resolved: 1 (0 HIGH, 0 MEDIUM, 1 LOW)
- Version bump: v1.1.1 → v1.1.2

### Verification

- ✅ "Relationship to Cross-Reference" note now explains Optional may include additional helpful categories
- ✅ Version header updated to v1.1.2

### Remaining Items

None — command is production-ready at v1.1.2.

## [2025-12-31 11:45] Critical Analysis v1.3.2 & v1.1.2: Consistency & UX Fixes

### Description

Second comprehensive critical analysis of `/product-interview` v1.3.1 and `/audit-context` v1.1.1 identified 4 real issues plus 1 minor improvement. All issues have been resolved with focus on cross-file consistency and UX improvements.

### New Files Created

None.

### Modified Files

| File                                              | Modification                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/audit-context.md`     | Fixed `/product-vision` requirements (Required: 1, Optional: 2 — was incorrectly marking both as Required) |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/product-interview.md` | Added `--minimal` early exit logic, added `--audit` vs `/audit-context` clarification note                 |
| `agents.md`                                       | Added `/sample-data` to Category 5's "Used By Commands" column                                             |

### Issues Resolved

**MEDIUM (3):**

- **MEDIUM-001:** `/audit-context` Command Readiness showed `/product-vision` Required: 1, 2 — but Category 2 (User Research & Personas) is optional per `/product-vision.md` Step 0. Fixed to Required: 1, Optional: 2.
- **MEDIUM-002:** `agents.md` Context Categories table was missing `/sample-data` in Category 5's "Used By Commands" — inconsistent with `/product-interview` Cross-Reference and `/audit-context` Command Readiness. Added `/sample-data`.
- **MEDIUM-003:** `/product-interview` had no early exit for `--minimal` mode when all 6 minimal categories are complete — unlike `--stage` mode which had explicit handling. Added `check_minimal_completion()` function and user options.

**LOW (1):**

- **LOW-001:** Unclear when to use `--audit` flag vs `/audit-context` command — users could be confused. Added clarification note explaining: `--audit` for quick status, `/audit-context` for deep analysis.

**ALREADY FIXED (1):**

- **HIGH-001:** `/design-tokens` missing from `/audit-context` Command Readiness table — was already present in v1.1.1 (no action needed).

### Statistics

- Files modified: 3
- Issues resolved: 4 (0 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM, 1 LOW)
- Already fixed: 1 (discovered `/design-tokens` was already in table)

### Verification

- ✅ `/product-vision` Command Readiness shows Required: 1, Optional: 2
- ✅ Category 5 "Used By Commands" now includes `/sample-data`
- ✅ `--minimal` early exit with `check_minimal_completion()` function added
- ✅ `--audit` vs `/audit-context` clarification note added in Recovery section
- ✅ All cross-references consistent between 3 files

### Remaining Items

None — both commands are production-ready.

## [2025-12-31 11:15] Critical Analysis v1.3.1 & v1.1.1: Bug Fixes & Documentation Clarity

### Description

Comprehensive critical analysis of `/product-interview` v1.3.0 and `/audit-context` v1.1.0 identified 4 real issues (2 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM) plus 2 LOW observations. All issues have been resolved with version bumps to v1.3.1 and v1.1.1 respectively.

### New Files Created

None.

### Modified Files

| File                                              | Modification                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/product-interview.md` | v1.3.0 → v1.3.1: Added MINIMAL_MODE check to should_ask_category(), Option Limit patterns for Q4.1 and Q11.2, Cross-Reference template filtering notes |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/audit-context.md`     | v1.1.0 → v1.1.1: Added C-021 check, improved Command Readiness table with explanations, updated check range references                                 |
| `agents.md`                                       | Updated Command Versions table with v1.3.1 and v1.1.1 notes                                                                                            |

### Issues Resolved

**HIGH (2):**

- **HIGH-001:** MINIMAL_MODE category filtering not implemented — `should_ask_category()` checked `$STAGE` but not `$MINIMAL_MODE`. Running `--minimal` would ask all 52 questions instead of ~29. Added check for categories 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11.
- **HIGH-002:** Two questions missing ⚠️ Option Limit warning — Question 4.1 (Aesthetic Tone) and Question 11.2 (Authorization Model) had 5 options each without the required two-part question pattern. Added Part A/B split patterns.

**MEDIUM (2):**

- **MEDIUM-001:** Command Readiness table confusing — "Required Categories" vs Cross-Reference section showed different values without explanation. Renamed columns to "Required (Blocking)" and "Optional (Enhancement)", added comprehensive explanation note with example.
- **MEDIUM-002:** Cross-Reference template contradicted filtering note — Note said to filter by category status but template showed all categories. Added "Template Note" and HTML comments indicating filtering conditions per command section.

**LOW (2):**

- **LOW-001:** Missing GDPR check in audit-context — Interview had "GDPR vs No PII data" (LOW) check without corresponding C-XXX check. Added C-021 and updated all references from "C-001 through C-020" to "C-001 through C-021".
- **LOW-002:** Severity differences undocumented — Same checks had different severities between interview (lighter) and audit (stricter). Added explanatory note about intentional difference with example.

### Statistics

- Files modified: 3
- Issues resolved: 6 (2 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, 2 LOW)
- Version bumps: product-interview v1.3.0 → v1.3.1, audit-context v1.1.0 → v1.1.1
- Consistency checks: C-001 to C-020 → C-001 to C-021

### Verification

- ✅ `should_ask_category()` now checks both `$STAGE` and `$MINIMAL_MODE`
- ✅ Question 4.1 has Part A/B pattern (3 options → 2 options based on selection)
- ✅ Question 11.2 has Part A/B pattern (3 options → 1-3 options based on selection)
- ✅ Command Readiness table has clear column names and explanatory note with example
- ✅ Cross-Reference template has filtering comments for all 9 command sections
- ✅ C-021 added to Consistency Checks table
- ✅ Check range updated in Step 3 note and Appendix
- ✅ Severity differences note added to Consistency Validation section
- ✅ agents.md Command Versions table updated

### Remaining Items

None — both commands are production-ready at v1.3.1 and v1.1.1.

| `.claude/commands/design-os/audit-context.md` | v1.0.0 → v1.1.0: Added AI Implementation Guidelines section to report template, pre/post-edit validation protocol, structure validation in Step 1, fixed report comparison logic in Step 10 |
| `agents.md`                                   | Added clarifying note about Command Prerequisites vs Command Readiness relationship, updated Command Versions table (v1.1.0)                                                                |

### Issues Resolved

**HIGH (1):**

- **HIGH-001:** Missing editing guidelines when user selects "Fix issues" — no instructions on preserving file format. Added comprehensive "AI Implementation Guidelines" section to report template with File Structure Rules, Edit Location Rules, Edit Pattern, Example Fixes, Automatic Validation Protocol, and Anti-Patterns.

**MEDIUM (3):**

- **MEDIUM-001:** Inconsistent Command Readiness tables between `/audit-context` and `agents.md` — added clarifying note explaining the relationship between FILE prerequisites and CATEGORY completeness requirements.
- **MEDIUM-002:** Report comparison logic read "previous" values AFTER overwriting the file — moved value capture to Step 1 before file is overwritten.
- **MEDIUM-003:** No structure validation for context file format — added validation for Quick Reference, Completeness line, section count (1-12), and Cross-Reference section.

**LOW (1):**

- **LOW-001:** `/audit-context` version not updated in agents.md — updated to v1.1.0 with notes about new features.

### Features Added

**AI Implementation Guidelines (in report template):**

- **File Structure Rules:** CRITICAL (don't modify) vs SAFE TO MODIFY elements
- **Edit Location Rules:** Table mapping issue types to where/how to edit
- **Edit Pattern:** 4-step process (Read → Identify → Replace → Verify)
- **Example Fixes:** Q-002, Q-005, C-001 with LOCATE/FIND/REPLACE format
- **Automatic Validation Protocol:** Pre-edit and post-edit bash scripts
- **Rollback Protocol:** Instructions if validation fails
- **Anti-Patterns:** Table of what NOT to do with explanations

**Structure Validation (Step 1):**

- Checks Quick Reference section exists
- Checks Completeness line exists
- Checks at least 6 of 12 category sections exist
- Checks Cross-Reference section exists
- Continues with warnings if structure issues found

**Report Comparison Fix (Step 10):**

- Pre-saves issue counts in Step 1 before report is overwritten
- Shows accurate before/after comparison
- Reports resolved issues, new issues, or no change

### Statistics

- Files modified: 2
- Lines changed: ~250
- Issues resolved: 5 (1 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM, 1 LOW)

- **M2:** No mid-interview abort guidance — Progress only saved at Step 14. Added ⚠️ No Auto-Save note at top with pause/summarize guidance.
- **M3:** Question 2.3 follow-up unclear — "Sunt câțiva competitori" option didn't explain next steps. Added Follow-up 2.3b section for competitor details.
- **M4:** Stage vs Cross-Reference confusion — `--stage=shell` asks Categories 3, 6, 7 but `/design-shell` reads 2, 3, 7, 9. Added clarifying note explaining intentional difference.

**Low (5):**

- **L1:** Variable reference note not visible — $INTERVIEW_MODE referenced in Step 0 but set in Step 1. Improved note with ⚠️ icon and variable initialization order.
- **L2:** Missing skip/empty answer handling — No guidance for "skip" or "N/A" answers. Added "Handling Skipped Questions" note in Step 2.
- **L3:** Recovery note location — At end of 2,043-line file. Now covered by prominent ⚠️ No Auto-Save note at top.

- **C5:** Mixed mode handling undefined — No logic for detecting/generating Incremental mode. Added complete bash script with mode detection and header generation.

**Medium (2):**

- **M1:** Unreachable consistency check — "MVP scope vs Advanced" check couldn't work (scope determined by /product-vision, not /product-interview). Changed to "Free model vs Enterprise features".
- **M2:** Error message format inconsistency — Didn't follow agents.md standard format. Fixed to `Error: [Component] - [Issue]. [Action].`

**Low (2):**

- **L1:** Backup file accumulation — No cleanup guidance for multiple backups. Added cleanup command to keep only 3 most recent.

### Gaps Resolved

**Critical (2):**

- **C1:** Bash 4+ dependency in validation script — `declare -A` associative arrays don't work on macOS default Bash 3.2. Replaced with POSIX-compatible `case` statements and `get_cmd_categories()` helper function.
- **C2:** Incomplete merge logic — `merge_category_content()` was a skeleton with placeholder comments. Replaced with comprehensive 5-step merge guidance and added Subsection-to-Question Mapping table for per-question detection.

**Medium (4):**

- **M1:** Ambiguous per-question detection — Only category-level detection existed. Added subsection-to-question mapping table covering all 12 categories.
- **M2:** --stage mode with complete categories undefined — No guidance when all categories in stage are already complete. Added `check_stage_completion()` function and user options (Revizuim oricum/Vedem altă zonă/Ieșim).
- **M3:** INTERVIEW_MODE referenced before definition — Variable used in Step 0's function but set in Step 1. Added clarifying note explaining the function is defined for later use.
- **M4:** Double-question flow for "Vedem ce avem" — Users had to answer 2 questions to see context and decide. Streamlined: show brief summary before first question, added 4 options including "E suficient" early exit.

**Low (2):**

- **L1:** Missing progress indicator guidance — No progress shown during 50+ question interview. Added progress template and question counts per category table (cumulative counts).
- **L2:** Question count inconsistency — agents.md said "~50 questions" but actual count is ~52 (full) and ~29 (minimal). Updated both occurrences.

### Statistics

- Files modified: 2
- Lines changed: ~150
- Issues resolved: 8 (2 Critical, 4 Medium, 2 Low)

## [2025-12-30 21:05] Critical Analysis: /product-interview v1.1.0 (10 Issues)

### Description

Comprehensive critical analysis identified 10 issues across 3 severity levels in the `/product-interview` command. This modification resolves ALL issues including critical implementation gaps for `--stage` mode, partial category merge logic, and output structure consistency.

### New Files Created

None.

| File                                              | Modification                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/product-interview.md` | v1.0.0 → v1.1.0: Added stage mode skip logic, partial merge logic (Step 14.1b), output structure handling, backup mechanism, cross-reference validation, validation renumbering, language notes |
| `agents.md`                                       | Updated Command Versions table: `/product-interview` v1.0.0 → v1.1.0                                                                                                                            |

### Gaps Resolved

**Critical (3):**

- **C1:** `--stage` mode implementation logic missing — Steps 2-13 only handled `complete_missing` mode, not stage-based filtering. Added `should_ask_category()` function with stage-to-category mapping and skip notes to all 12 category steps.
- **C2:** Partial category merge logic undefined — When `INTERVIEW_MODE="complete_missing"`, no instructions for preserving/merging existing answers. Added Step 14.1b with merge strategy, content preservation rules, and example dialog.
- **C3:** Output structure for stage/partial modes undefined — Unclear whether empty categories are omitted or included. Added "Handling Unanswered Categories" section requiring all 12 sections with placeholder notes for unanswered categories.

**Medium (4):**

- **M1:** Question numbering convention inconsistency — Only Category 1 had `.0` question, implying others have no required questions. Clarified convention: `.0` is an exception for Product Name, all others start at `.1`.
- **M2:** Validation step 6.5 naming anomaly — Decimal numbering inconsistent with integer steps. Renumbered: 6.5 → 7, 7 → 8, added new step 9 for cross-reference validation.
- **M3:** Cross-reference conditional logic not validated — Complex generation rules without verification. Added step 8 with associative array mapping commands to categories and validation loop.
- **M4:** No backup before overwrite — "Revizuim totul" would overwrite without saving. Added backup creation when completeness ≥25% with timestamped filename.

**Low (3):**

- **L1:** Recovery guidance content duplication — Similar content in Important Notes and Recovery section. Added reference to dedicated Recovery section.
- **L2:** Language example inconsistency — Unclear that Romanian prompts are examples. Added Language Note clarifying questions adapt to conversation language, outputs remain English.
- **L3:** mkdir logic clarity — `mkdir -p` followed by `if [ ! -d` was redundant. Simplified to `mkdir -p product || { error; exit 1; }`.

### Statistics

| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/product-interview.md` | Fixed 12 issues: categories count, COMPLETENESS null check, CONTEXT_FILE variable, directory verification, section title, stage validation, status format, audit recommendations, question numbering, progress workaround, cross-reference logic, consistency checks |
| `agents.md`                                       | Added Command Versions table documenting `/product-interview` v1.0.0 and placeholders for other commands                                                                                                                                                             |

### Gaps Resolved

**High (1):**

- **P0:** Mode comment said "5 categories only" but `--minimal` actually provides 6 categories — misleading documentation. Fixed to "6 critical categories".

**Medium (4):**

- **P1:** Missing COMPLETENESS null check in Step 1 — could cause empty variable errors. Added `if [ -z "$COMPLETENESS" ]; then COMPLETENESS=0; fi`.
- **P1:** Missing `--stage` parameter validation — invalid stage values would silently fail. Added case statement validation.
- **P1:** No workaround for interrupted long interviews — users lost all progress. Added "Workaround for Long Interviews" section.
- **P1:** Cross-reference section lacked implementation guidance — unclear how to conditionally omit empty categories. Added explicit 3-step implementation notes.

**Low (8):**

- **P2:** Hardcoded path vs variable inconsistency — `product/product-context.md` hardcoded in Step 1 but `CONTEXT_FILE` variable used elsewhere. Unified to use variable.
- **P2:** Missing directory creation verification — `mkdir -p product` had no success check. Added verification with error message.
- **P2:** Mixed language in section title — "Completăm ce lipsește" mode title was confusing. Added clarifying note.
- **P2:** Status format undocumented — emoji vs text fallback behavior not explained. Clarified in note.
- **P2:** Audit recommendations not tiered — generic recommendation regardless of completeness level. Added 4-tier recommendations (0-25%, 26-49%, 50-74%, 75%+).
- **P2:** Question 2.0 numbering unusual — `.0` suffix not explained. Added "Question Numbering Convention" note.
- **P2:** Command version not in agents.md — `/product-interview` v1.0.0 not documented. Added Command Versions table.
- **P2:** Consistency validation incomplete — missing GDPR/PII, Offline/Real-time, PWA/Desktop checks. Added 3 new validation rules.

### Statistics

- Files modified: 2
- Lines changed: ~80
- Issues resolved: 13 (1 High, 4 Medium, 8 Low)

### Verification

### Gaps Resolved

**Critical (4):**

- **P0:** `--minimal` mode provided only 5 categories (41.7%) — below the 50% threshold required by other commands. Fixed by adding Category 7 (Mobile & Responsive) → now 6 categories = 50%
- **P0:** 7 of 12 category names differed between agents.md and product-interview.md — could cause parser failures in category skip logic. Standardized all names.
- **P0:** "Vedem ce avem" mode had no implementation — option was offered but logic was missing. Added full implementation with context summary display and follow-up options.
- **P0:** Product name was never explicitly asked — output template had `[Product Name]` placeholder that would never be filled. Added Question 2.0.

**High (4):**

- **P1:** Emoji parsing fragility — direct emoji matching (✅⚠️❌) could fail with UTF-8 variations. Changed to pattern matching with text fallbacks (Complete/Partial/Empty).
- **P1:** Validation script false warnings — didn't exclude subsection headers (###), table formatters (|---|), block quotes (>). Fixed line counting.
- **P1:** No error handling for context parsing — no warning if multiple table rows matched a category. Added duplicate detection.
- **P1:** Recovery instructions incomplete — only mentioned 2 of 3 options. Now lists all three (Completăm/Vedem/Revizuim).

**Medium (4):**

- **P2:** No step-to-category mapping table — only a note saying "Step 2 = Category 1". Added explicit 12-row mapping table.
- **P2:** Cross-reference section incomplete — missing references for categories 2, 8, 9, 12. Added complete references per agents.md table.
- **P2:** Flag hints missing from other commands — users didn't know about --minimal, --stage. Added tips to all 8 command files.
- **P2:** Mode table ambiguous — "Categories" column didn't clarify these were category numbers (1-12) not step numbers (0-14). Added clarifying note.

**Low (2):**

- **P3:** Language reminder not prominent at Step 14 — could forget to output in English. Added explicit reminder.
- **P3:** Mode documentation inconsistency — agents.md said "5 categories" after we changed to 6. Fixed.

### Statistics

- Files modified: 10
- Lines changed: ~200
- Issues resolved: 14 (4 Critical, 4 High, 4 Medium, 2 Low)

### Verification

- ✅ `--minimal` now provides 6 categories (50% threshold met)
- ✅ All 12 category names consistent between agents.md and product-interview.md
- ✅ "Vedem ce avem" mode fully implemented with context summary
- ✅ Product Name (Question 2.0) added to Step 2
- ✅ Emoji parsing handles both emoji and text statuses
- ✅ Validation script excludes formatting elements
- ✅ Duplicate category warning added
- ✅ Recovery instructions show all 3 options
- ✅ Step-to-category mapping table added
- ✅ Cross-reference complete for all 12 categories
- ✅ Flag tips added to 8 command files
- ✅ Mode table clarified with note
- ✅ Language reminder at Step 14
- ✅ Mode documentation consistent

### Remaining Items

None — all identified issues resolved. Command is production-ready.

| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `agents.md`                                       | Fixed completeness formula documentation (line 1464), added `--skip-validation` flag (line 67), added minimal mode explanation table (lines 1490-1500)                                                                                           |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/product-interview.md` | Fixed grep anchor (line 54), added content validation script (lines 1279-1295), removed `/screenshot-design` from Cross-Reference, renamed "Error Handling Strategy" → "Error Handling" (3 occurrences), clarified language requirement (line 7) |
| `.claude/commands/design-os/export-product.md`    | Fixed grep anchor to use `^Completeness:` pattern (line 54)                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Gaps Resolved

- **P0:** Completeness calculation formula mismatch between `agents.md` and `product-interview.md` — could cause incorrect threshold calculations
- **P0:** Grep pattern inconsistency (missing `^` anchor) in 2 files — could match wrong lines if "Completeness:" appears elsewhere in file
- **P1:** Missing `--skip-validation` flag documentation in `agents.md` — users couldn't discover this feature
- **P1:** Validation script only checked headings, not content — empty sections could pass validation
- **P2:** Cross-Reference included non-consuming command (`/screenshot-design`) — confusing documentation
- **P2:** Category naming inconsistency ("Error Handling Strategy" vs "Error Handling")
- **P2:** Language requirement hardcoded to Romanian — clarified as example, outputs must be English
- **P2:** Minimal mode categories not explained — added table showing WHY categories 1, 3, 5, 6, 11 were chosen

### Statistics

- Files modified: 3
- Lines changed: ~50
- Issues resolved: 8 (2 P0, 2 P1, 4 P2)

### Verification

- ✅ Completeness formula now consistent across all documentation
- ✅ All grep patterns use `^` anchor for line-start matching
- ✅ `--skip-validation` flag documented in agents.md
- ✅ Content validation added to Step 14.3 validation script
- ✅ Cross-Reference section cleaned up
- ✅ Category naming aligned
- ✅ Language requirement clarified
- ✅ Minimal mode explanation added

### Remaining Items (Not Fixed - Low Priority)

- Question counts table in agents.md (would help estimate duration)
- Recovery section improvements (draft auto-save feature request)
- Additional consistency validation checks in product-interview.md
