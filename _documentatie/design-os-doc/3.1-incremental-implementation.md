  Design OS Incremental Implementation

For larger products or when you want to review progress incrementally, this approach lets you build one section at a time.

How It Works
------------

Work through the instructions in order:

1.  **Foundation** (`instructions/incremental/01-foundation.md`) — Design tokens, data model types, routing
2.  **Shell** (`instructions/incremental/02-shell.md`) — Application shell and navigation
3.  **Sections** (`instructions/incremental/03-*.md`, `04-*.md`, etc.) — Each feature section, one at a time

For Each Milestone
------------------

1.  Open `product-plan/prompts/section-prompt.md`
2.  Fill in the section variables at the top (SECTION\_NAME, SECTION\_ID, NN)
3.  Add any section-specific notes
4.  Deliver the prompt to your coding agent in **Plan mode**
5.  Answer clarifying questions, then give the go-ahead to implement
6.  Review and test before moving to the next milestone

#### Why Plan Mode?

Plan mode encourages the agent to analyze the instructions thoroughly, ask clarifying questions, and build a complete implementation plan before writing code. This catches issues early and ensures the plan works for your codebase.

The Section Prompt
------------------

The section prompt is designed to give your agent everything it needs:

*   References the section's instruction file and assets
*   Points to `tests.md` for test-driven development
*   Asks about auth, data relationships, and integration points

Benefits of Incremental Implementation
--------------------------------------

*   **Easier review** — Review and test each section before moving on
*   **Catch issues early** — Problems are contained to a single section
*   **Better control** — You decide when each section is ready
*   **Flexible pacing** — Take breaks between sections as needed
