  Design OS Codebase Implementation

Getting Started
---------------

1.  Copy the `product-plan/` folder into your target codebase
2.  Start your AI coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
3.  Choose your implementation approach below

Implementation Approaches
-------------------------

Choose the approach that best fits your project:

*   [Incremental Implementation](https://buildermethods.com/design-os/incremental-implementation) — Recommended for larger products or when you want to review progress section by section.
*   [One-Shot Implementation](https://buildermethods.com/design-os/one-shot-implementation) — For simpler products or when you want to build everything in one session.

Start with Plan Mode
--------------------

The provided prompts assume you'll deliver them to Claude Code (or Cursor) in **Plan mode**. This encourages the agent to:

*   Analyze the instructions and design specifications thoroughly
*   Ask clarifying questions about functional requirements
*   Build a complete implementation plan that works for your specific codebase and tech stack

Once you're satisfied with the plan, give your agent the go-ahead to begin implementation.

Implementation Instructions
---------------------------

The provided prompts, instruction files, and referenced assets are designed to instruct your agent to:

*   Read and analyze the design specifications before writing code
*   Use the provided UI components as-is—don't redesign or restyle them
*   Follow the data model types defined in the export
*   Implement backend: database schema, API endpoints, business logic
*   Use test-driven development with the provided `tests.md` instructions
*   Handle empty states and error states gracefully
*   Use sample data for initial testing before building real APIs
*   Ask clarifying questions about auth, user modeling, and integration points

Tips
----

*   **Use the pre-written prompts** — They include important clarifying questions about auth and data modeling.
*   **Add your own notes** — Customize prompts with project-specific context when needed.
*   **Build on your designs** — Use completed sections as the starting point for future feature development.
*   **Review thoroughly** — Check plans and implementations carefully to catch details and inconsistencies.
*   **Fill in the gaps** — Backend business logic may need manual additions. Incremental implementation helps you identify these along the way.
