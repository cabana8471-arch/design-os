  Design OS Requirements

Running Design OS
-----------------

Design OS runs locally on your machine. You'll need:

*   **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
*   **npm** (comes with Node.js)
*   **An AI coding agent** — Claude Code is recommended as Design OS comes with custom slash commands for Claude Code. If you prefer a different tool (Cursor, Codex, Gemini, etc.) you can simply reference the commands in those tools using @ followed by the path to the `.claude/commands/design-os/[command-name].md` file.

Installing Your Exported Components
-----------------------------------

When you export your designs, you get production-ready React components. Your target codebase needs:

### Required

*   **React** (v18 or higher)
*   **Tailwind CSS** (v4) — Components use Tailwind utility classes for styling

### Backend

Your backend can be anything—Rails, Laravel, Next.js API routes, Python, Go, whatever. Design OS only handles the frontend design layer.
