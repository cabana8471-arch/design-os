  Design OS Workflow

Each command is a conversation—the AI asks questions, you provide direction, and together you shape your product.

Design OS follows a structured sequence. Each step builds on the previous one.

### Phase 1: Product Planning

Before designing any screens, establish the foundation:

1.  **Product Vision** — Define what you're building and why
2.  **Product Roadmap** — Break your product into sections
3.  **Data Model** — Define the core entities in your system
4.  **Design Tokens** — Choose colors and typography
5.  **Application Shell** — Design navigation and layout

### Phase 2: Section Design

Once the foundation is set, work through each section:

1.  **Shape the Section** — Define scope and requirements
2.  **Create Sample Data** — Generate realistic data and types
3.  **Design the Screen** — Build the actual React components
4.  **Capture Screenshots** — Document the design (optional)

Repeat for each section in your roadmap.

### Phase 3: Export

When all sections are designed:

1.  **Export** — Generate the complete handoff package
